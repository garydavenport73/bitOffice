{"text":"<h1>My test document.</h1>\n<h2>Some explanation needed here:</h2>\n<p>There are many ways a person can write a document and many things to try.  Here are a few things:</p>\n&bullet; Try to make some text <b>bold</b>.\n&bullet; Try to make some text <u>underlined</u>.\n&bullet; Try to make some text <em>italicized</em>.\n\nAnd you can check the button for spell-check if you <em>really</em> want to.\n\nBut that is mostly what I have to say.  Although, smaller headings are possible like: <h2>this one</h2> or <h3>this one.</h3>\n<p>And you can tab the beginnings of paragraphs, since they currently are not tabbed by default.</p>\n<hr>\nI think horizontal lines are helpful at times so I put one just above this paragraph.\n\n<h2>Summary:</h2>\nAll in all, you can make basic documents this way.  Then you can:\n\t1) Save them to a file, and this will be loaded back into this program like any word processor.  (The document format is JSON format, which is <em>somewhat</em> human readable.)\n\t2) You can export the file to an html file, which can be opened in just about any browser.\n\t3) If you are old-fashioned, you can print it with the print button.\n\n<h3>The end:</h3>\nThanks for reading the document.\n\nBest regards,\n\n\n<hr>Doc Write","textAlign":"","fontFamily":"","fontSize":"1rem","marginSize":"2rem","spellCheck":true}
